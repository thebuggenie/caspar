# MVC explained
Caspar is a lightweight, no-nonsense MVC-framework for building modern PHP applications, but what does that really 
mean?

Luckily, many other people have tried to explained the MVC pattern in an understandable format. Have a look at these
two well-written posts, explaining the MVC pattern with relatable concepts:

#### Legos
[MVC summarized with Legos](https://realpython.com/the-model-view-controller-mvc-paradigm-summarized-with-legos/) is a great article written by [Real Python](https://realpython.com/). While the code examples are 
written with Python in mind, the actual MVC pattern is explained with real-life Lego examples.

#### Ordering drinks at a bar
In [MVC explained through ordering drinks](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/model-view-controller-mvc-explained-through-ordering-drinks-at-the-bar-efcba6255053) you learn about the way MVC applications are structured
by comparing it to ordering drinks at a bar.

## Now what
Taking the concepts explained in the two articles above, Caspar provides all the necessary building blocks to build an 
MVC-structured, modern PHP application.
