# Your first application
Getting to grips with all the information can be a bit daunting, so the best way to learn the framework is to learn by 
doing. In this tutorial, you'll build a small blog. The blog application will also have an administration section that
will allow anyone with administrator access to create new blog entries.

# Structure
Your blog application will have two modules, `main` and `admin`. We'll use this later to put the administration logic 
and handling in the `admin` module, and have the public-facing parts in the `main` module.

**Note:** We're going to start from scratch, but we're assuming you have followed the [Installation guide](installation.md) to 
install Caspar and the dependencies for a project at least once, so you know how to set up the web server to handle 
incoming requests.

When you're ready to start, head over to the next section to set up the default structure of your application.
